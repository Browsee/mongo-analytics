# mongo-analytics
A mongoDB based simple counter to store time series based data.

This module is not meant to be a replacement for time series databases like
InfluxDB, Druid etc. This is just meant as a starting point for projects which
are already using MongoDB or want to use MongoDB and have some basic analytics
needs to show in their UI.
